# Counter Challenge

We have two components already written, App and Counter. They don't really work just yet, but that's what we are going to do today!

Now for the requirements.

## How this should work

- Move the initial data out of the global state
- Clicking the plus and minus buttons should increment and decrement each counter
- Create a `Total` component that keeps a running summary of all the counters
- Add a fourth counter and ensure its value remains independent from the others
